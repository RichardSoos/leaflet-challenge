# Module 15 Challenge leaflet + javascript earthquake data visualisation.
# My data source for Visualisation is 
# from USGS (United States Geological Survey Science Bureau) Site.
# https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/4.5_month.geojson
# This GeoJSON Data may be found manually from the home page
# https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php
# by selecting Past 30 days M4.5+ Earthquakes
# leaflet-part-1 has under starter_code folder index.html. Running this will # execute under static subfolder logic.js
# Part 1 will simply mark on a street(world) map volcanoes sized by 
# magnitude with a larger circle marker. They will also be coloured by depth # of quake and a legend explaining the depth will be displayed.
# Part 2 has a similiar folder structure. Folder leaflet-part-2 has under 
# starter_code folder index.html. Running this will execute under its own 
# static subfolder, logic.js
# This part 2 will enhance the code of part1. 
# Topographic map is also selectable and 
# any/ both or none of tectonic plate overlay and earthquake markers may be # displayed.
# The tectonic plate site is https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates
